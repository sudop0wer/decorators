# decorators.py

A Python script that manages a login system with classes and decorators.

## Functionality

This Python script implements a simple user authentication system using classes and decorators. It allows users to log in, log out, and perform specific actions like posting messages or viewing profiles, but only if they are authenticated. The script defines a `User` class to manage user credentials and authentication status, while the `requires_authentication` decorator ensures that sensitive functions can only be executed by logged-in users. There is also a public feed browsing function that can be accessed without login. The script includes some predefined users and demonstrates how to authenticate and use the system.
