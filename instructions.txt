Quest: User Authentication System
You need to create a Python program that simulates an API with multiple functions, but certain functions
can only be accessed if the user is authenticated. You will use decorators to enforce authentication.

Requirements:

1. Create a decorator called requires_authentication that will:
- Check if a user is logged in.
- If the user is authenticated, allow access to the function.
- If the user is not authenticated, print a message denying access.

2. Simulate a simple login/logout mechanism.
- Use a variable like is_authenticated to track whether a user is logged in or not.

3. Write several functions, some of which require the user to be authenticated to access, such as:
- view_profile(): View the user's profile (requires authentication).
- post_message(message): Post a message (requires authentication).
- browse_public_feed(): Browse the public feed (does not require authentication).
